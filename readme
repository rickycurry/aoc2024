# Curry-Civitarese AoC 2024

## How to run
1. Grab your puzzle input from [AoC](adventofcode.com) by following the input link and saving the page as `x.txt`, where `x` is the date of the puzzle (i.e. `[1, 25]`). Save it in the `data` directory.
1. The entry point is `aoc-runner.js`. We run our code in the terminal with the following command:
  
    ```
    node aoc-runner.js x [verbosity]
    ```
    Where `x` is the date of the puzzle, as above, and `verbosity` is an optional level of logging verbosity, one of `{ info, debug }`. The default level if omitted is `info`.
